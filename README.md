# Param-GTFB-GCFB

We proposed the parameterized gammatone and gammachirp filterbanks for source separation. They are based on a given family function, whose parameters are jointly learned with the network. Here, the design of filterbank is provided, and other parts of ConvTasNet are based on Asteroid audio source separation toolkit (https://github.com/mpariente/asteroid).
